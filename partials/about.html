        <p>My name is Dau Lam. I am a senior at Temple University pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I will be graduating in May 2016. Technology has always been my thing ever since I could remember. I still chuckle at the days when I wrote simple functions on my TI-83 throughout high school. I developed a strong affinity for computer programming at that same school where I was fortunate enough to take Java programming with my wonder instructor Mr. Lee Silverman. From that, I was able to gain experience as a developer which has led me to many interesting things.</p>

        <p>My strongest area of expertise is object-oriented programming in Java and C++. However I am also very excited learn anything new and fresh. I am very eager to and always like to tinker with new technologies. Lately I have been getting into web development - experimenting with Javascript/jQuery and different server-side scripting languages. Besides coding, I like to stay current on new innovations in hardware and security. Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis and cooking.</p>
